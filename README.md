# odin-recipes
## Pre-attempt
This is the first project in the Odin Project. Here, the aim is to program a bare bones recipe website from scratch using the HTML That has been taught. This all has been written beforehand, as to just describe the project's aim and another part will be written after the coding has been done, explaining the process.

## Post-attempt
This first project was extremely well thought out and really tested my knowledge on how to actively work on HTML. Some of the only problems I found while working on it was the fact that some of the images I had were too large and at this point in time, we have not been told how to resize them. I already know that we will be doing that in the future, so I have no complaints.

The project has really shown me how much HTML I have actually learned, surprisingly. I have confidence that there is more to learn in the future!
